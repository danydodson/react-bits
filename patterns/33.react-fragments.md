# React Fragments

React fragments are used whenever a component needs returned with multiple children.

Specifically, fragments are useful when I don't want to clutter the DOM with unnecessary `<div>` tags that are used purely to wrap children in a React render method.

For example, React fragments are commonly used to render list items:
```javascript
render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <td>Table Cell 1</td>
        <td>Table Cell 2</td>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
```

This solves the issue of breaking the DOM HTML table specifications by not adding unnecessary `<div>` elements around `<td>` elements.
Do keep in mind, if it is a list being rendered, React does still throw warnings when children don't have the `key={}` prop.
